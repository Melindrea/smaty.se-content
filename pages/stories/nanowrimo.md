You don't know what that is? Well, no worries, I will help educate you.

[NaNoWriMo](http://nanowrimo.org/) happens every November, when you aim to write
50 000 words during that month. It's really only a competition against yourself,
but it's a fun social event.

Every April and July, there's [Camp NaNoWriMo](http://campnanowrimo.org/), which
is a lot looser in format (for one, you can choose your own word count target),
and you get assigned "cabins" with a private chat.

## Attempts at NaNoWriMo

### November 2012
I had originally intended to write erotica, but I now know that I can't do that.
Also, due to not having prepared for NaNo at all, I barely hit 30k on it before
the end of November.

### November 2013

The story I had intended to write the year before, had gotten a year to work, and
it was better for it. The characters had matured, and I had a far better idea
on what story I was actually telling.

**Current status:** 2nd draft, in process of being translated into English

### Camp July 2014
I had intended to write the free-standing sequel to Nov 2013, but ended up
distracted, so I had to forfeit that camp. The sequel is still in my to-be-written
list.

### November 2014

Instead of writing the aforementioned sequel, I wrote the third in the trilogy,
and while I finished with 55k, the story itself ended up closer to 65k in the
first draft.

**Current status:** Resting and being refocused so it can be filled up with
the things for 2nd draft

### Camp April 2015
My plan is to write a series of short stories set in this world, where I am
aiming for 50k in total.
