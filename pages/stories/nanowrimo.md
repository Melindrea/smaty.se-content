You don't know what that is? Well, no worries, I will help educate you.

[NaNoWriMo](http://nanowrimo.org/) happens every November, when you aim to write
50 000 words during that month. It's really only a competition against yourself,
but it's a fun social event.

Every April and July, there's [Camp NaNoWriMo](http://campnanowrimo.org/), which
is a lot looser in format (for one, you can choose your own word count target),
and you get assigned "cabins" with a private chat.

## Attempts at NaNoWriMo
### Camp April 2015

I did it! Four completed short stories, the outline for a novella (or full-length novel),
and the beginning of two more stories.

#### Current status
* **The Angel Maker**: 1st draft (8.6k), contemporary ghost story
* **The Fiddler**: 1st draft (11k), contemporary folklore
* **Priestess of Ran**: 1st draft (12.3k), Viking age war/supernatural
* **Why did it have to be snakes?**: 1st draft (8.7k), contemporary supernatural
* **Forgive and forget**: Unfinished 1st draft (2.4k), Viking age struggle for independence
* **Dreams**: 1st draft under revision (4.1k), contemporary dream world
* **The Honeysuckle Maiden**: Unfinished 1st draft (1.5k), contemporary/historical supernatural

### November 2014

Instead of writing the aforementioned sequel, I wrote the third in the trilogy,
and while I finished with 55k, the story itself ended up closer to 65k in the
first draft.

#### Current status
Resting and being refocused so it can be filled up with the things for 2nd draft

### Camp July 2014
I had intended to write the free-standing sequel to Nov 2013, but ended up
distracted, so I had to forfeit that camp. The sequel is still in my to-be-written
list.

### November 2013

The story I had intended to write the year before, had gotten a year to work, and
it was better for it. The characters had matured, and I had a far better idea
on what story I was actually telling.

#### Current status
2nd draft, in process of being translated into English

### November 2012
I had originally intended to write erotica, but I now know that I can't do that.
Also, due to not having prepared for NaNo at all, I barely hit 30k on it before
the end of November.
