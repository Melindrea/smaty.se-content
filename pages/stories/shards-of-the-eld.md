This story started as a supposed-erotica in 2012 NaNoWriMo. I wrote 20 000 words and gave up, since (as it turns out) I'm really bad at writing actual erotica. I can do sexual tension, but not really the actual sex scenes.

In November 2013 I had worked on the ideas during the summer, and taken a week off work, so I managed to win that year, writing in Swedish. After that I let it rest, since I knew there were more in the series, but am now translating it to English, since the trilogy is plotted out, if not written yet.
