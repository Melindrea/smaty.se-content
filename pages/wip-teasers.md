## Priestess of Ran
** 9/4, 2015 **

She took a moment to compose herself, studying the leader. It could be a trick question, at which point pretending to be a Christian would be the wrong answer, or he could be a Christian robber, or even loyal to the King. Nothing in his clothes gave his allegiances away. She forced herself into a standing position, and to her surprise Aslak let her.

“Yes.” A small grin played on her lips. Something in the air filled her with exhilaration. “And I am part of it.”

** 7/4, 2015 **

Helga tensed again, closing her eyes as she forced the illusion of strength. She could not let Saga know her own uncertainty. “No, not now. For all I know, he would be looking for me to bring me to the king in chains.” Bitterness seeped through her deep voice. “They called me a changeling; there will be no mercy from them.”

** 5/4, 2015 **

A trilling from the side of the road heralded a ginger and white cat. He shook his furred body and nosed at Helga’s leg. The hint of a smile played over her lips as she picked him up.

## The Angel Maker
** 4/4, 2015 **

“You can come with me, but stay with the boat. And if … Well, if this is just in my mind, it’ll be a short trip. If it’s not, and I don’t make it, I need you to call Jasbir, and I need you to move on.” I move to the bed and pull him in for a hug. “I promise, this isn’t anything to do with … us. It’s just something I need to do.” He hugs me back, and I bury my face in his hair, closing my eyes.

** 3/4, 2015 **

“That sounds about right.” I shake my head, thumbing through the diary. “Here’s what the priest has to say: ‘Five more children had been entrusted into her care, but we didn’t find her or them. I suggested to her brother that she might be hiding in their father’s home, but he claims he already looked. I keep my faith that God will sort both of them out, if he lied to me.’”

** 2/4, 2015**

“No, not quite … I mean, I’m more a guy than I ever was a woman, but … He-pronouns are okay, but I prefer they. Non-binary, I guess.” Her easy acceptance lifts a weight from my shoulders, even as it leaves me feeling like someone took a sandbag to my head.

** 1/4, 2015**

Her constant forays into saying things she shouldn’t had lightened my mood considerably. After all, she was at least apologising. “Thanks. By the way, whose is that cat outside? The tabby?”


## Awaiting Valhalla

**22/3, 2015**

She filled the bread with stew and gobbled it down with her face turned away from him. “Mother died several months ago. I took the spear and shield off my father’s arrow-ridden body.” The grief and anger in her expression was palpable. “And I will avenge him.”


**18/3, 2015**

“You will have to find a different place, my friend, or wait until Bóthildr is done.” Kóri’s gaze caressed Hallbjórn’s furred chest and broad shoulders, down over the loose linen undergarments and muscular legs. His hands trembled and his bare feet rubbed against the coarse stone as he shifted from one foot to the other.

**15/3 2015**

Kóri laughed, the madness of battle sweeping him into its arms as he danced with Valkyrias anew. His axe bit and clawed into another man. A golden cross glittered around the enemy’s neck. Dead eyes glittered no more; White Christ had failed.
