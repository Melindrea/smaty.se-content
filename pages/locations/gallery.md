excerpt: "Images of ancient sights around Tanumshede, Bohuslän (formerly Ranrike), taken by Marie Hogebrandt and Jonathan Buck. Inspiration and beauty."

All these pictures are © Marie Hogebrandt and Jonathan Buck, and taken by us around Tanumshede in the north of Bohuslän. To not spoil anything, the image descriptions do not mention how--or if--they appear in the stories.

To get a larger image and a description on what it is, click on the image for a lightbox. However, if you are on a device that's smaller than a particular width (generally smartphones), clicking it will open the larger picture to allow you to zoom natively instead.
