## Typefaces

Main headings are Atreyu by [Greg Eckler](http://www.theviciouscircus.com/), distributed by [Lost Type](http://losttype.com/).

The body typeface is [Linux Libertine](http://www.linuxlibertine.org/index.php?id=1&L=1). It is open source, and the family includes both the main serif, a complementing sans-serif (called Linux Biolinum) and the attractive Linux Libertine Initial, which is used for the drop caps.

## Graphics

Background is a [linen texture](http://murder-stock.deviantart.com/art/Linen-Texture-1-213796339) by [murder-stock](http://murder-stock.deviantart.com/) that
I manipulated into the various backgrounds.

All other graphics are photographed by either me or Jonathan Buck,
and manipulated by me into the forms used on the site.

## Design

This is entirely my designing and imagining, with support from other
projects and people.

## Beta Readers
No one can write without good support in the form of beta readers. In particular
beta readers who are not afraid of saying when something *isn't* working just as
much as giving the praise that a fragile writer ego needs.

So, in no particular order, here's a list of the awesome people who's helped me
better my craft with their analysis.
