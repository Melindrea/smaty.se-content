While they all fit within the same world and same timeline, the themes
of each story is different, and what they explore is different.

## [Flashfiction](/stories/flashfiction)

Stories that are up to 1000 words.

## [Microfiction](/stories/microfiction)

Each story is less than 140 characters long, and explores how much
of a twist you can create in that short a space. Most are 3rd person
point-of-view, but a few are written in 1st person.

## [NaNoWriMo](/stories/nanowrimo)

One way to keep motivated, for me, is to push my limits during a few months out
of the year. The community around the events helps quite a lot.
