When making characters, the key thing is to make them come to live. If you
don't know them well enough, you can't write them well enough.

Be warned that the characters profile are likely to contain spoilers.

## Profiles

* Bóthildr Gudhleksdotter--a maiden seeking retribution in war

## Next up
In order, but exact timing on when it goes live is undecided.

1. Mio Malm--a trans person whose pain awakens the ghosts of a killer
    and her child-victims
2. Katja Bradley--a fashion designer whose love drove her into servitude as a
    Valkyria
3. Malbrecht mac Coluim--a warrior lost in time and place who failed to save his
    charge once, but this time it's his love on the line
4. Belinda Eriksson--a traumatised seer whose abilities can only blossom if she
    overrules her mind's view of the truth
