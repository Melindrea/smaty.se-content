When making characters, the key thing is to make them come to live. If you
don't know them well enough, you can't write them well enough.

Be warned that the characters profile are likely to contain spoilers.

* [Helga Yngvesdotter](/characters/helga-yngvesdotter)--an orphan seeking power
against the religious fanatics who slayed her father

    charge once, but this time it's his love on the line

    overrules her mind's view of the truth
