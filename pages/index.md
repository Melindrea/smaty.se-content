This page is about a world that exists in my imagination, at least
mainly. It’s called *Småty* since that’s a dialectal word from Bohuslän, Sweden,
for the various supernatural critters in the world.

[The stories][stories] are a mix of historical and contemporary, something in
the magical realism line. They are all set in Sweden, generally with
connection to Bohuslän, which in old times was known as either *Alfheim*
or *Ranrike*. I prefer Ranrike, so that is the term used in my world.

Check out [the characters][characters] (which includes interviews and bios), [the
locations][locations] and their real-world inspiration, or [the stories][stories], which has excerpts of longer works as well as both
microfiction ( up to 140 characters) and flash fiction (up to about 1000
words).
