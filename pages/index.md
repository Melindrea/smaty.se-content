This page is about a world that exists in my imagination, at least
mainly. It’s called *Småty* since that’s a dialectal word from Bohuslän, Sweden,
for the various supernatural critters in the world. If you are interested in
Viking historical fiction and contemporary magical realism inspired by Scandinavian
folklore (including the Norse gods), this is a good place to be.

[The stories][stories] are a mix of historical (mainly the iron age, both
before the so-called Viking age and during) and contemporary, something in
the magical realism line. They are all set in Sweden, generally with
connection to Bohuslän, which in old times was known as either *Alfheim*
or *Ranrike*. I prefer Ranrike, so that is the term used in my world.

Check out [the characters][characters] (which includes interviews and bios), [the
locations][locations] and their real-world inspiration, or [the stories][stories], which has excerpts of longer works as well as both
microfiction (up to 140 characters) and flash fiction (up to about 1000
words).
