## Dear friends,

It's been quite some time since I last sent out this newsletter, because life really go in my way, big time. There's been a lot of changes: I have a new job that I love, but that takes up a lot of my time, and I've also decided to become really serious about my writing.

The first thing here is that I am revising *Angel Maker* with the intent of publishing it in March. The cover will be designed by the ever-so-lovely [Kristine]
(http://kristinewyllys.com/), and if all goes well I will be doing a cover reveal in the next newsletter.

First, I apologise for not having sent out a newsletter in July. I pretty much woke up like July 4th and went "huh, I think I forgot to do something ..." and decided to give it a summer holiday.

As for my writing plans:

* Halfway-house of Souls is resting. I still like it, and will get back to it eventually
* Helga Ramn's short story has had a few revisions, but not been completed yet
* Mentor of Dreams is scrapped for now. Maybe some day I will pick it up, but for now it doesn't work for me at all
* I have a [revision guide!](https://melindrea.github.io/revision-guide/)

I did manage to get a nice author photograph, which is used on my new site [AntoniusM.se](https://antoniusm.se/), as well as in some other places. 

It's my birthday the 2nd, and I bought myself a Moleskin notebook that I'm intending to use for writing exercises. While I've never managed to do journaling, someone else suggested checking out bullet journaling, so apart from sections for the exercises, I also setup a journal for February.

### Writing plans

* Finish revisions on *Angel Maker* and hire someone to do line edits
* Write the first draft of an unnamed ghost story featuring the non-binary Vide and feir friend Lo
* Write at least one note daily in my new journal
* Do at least four writing exercises

### Around the web

Back in October, I did a guest post for [Jill Marcotte's blog](https://jillmarcotte.wordpress.com/2015/10/19/matter-of-factly-fictional/)

### Teaser

For this month, you'll get the first scene in *Out of Ashes and Ocean*, Helga Ramn's prequel.

<blockquote>

As the sun set, the bared bedrock cooled under Helga’s bared feet. Her friend and thrall fussed around her—smoothing out the worn dress and arranging her tight locks around the golden circlet set with amber. From their perch, they saw men and women—free, freed and thralls—join the judges’ circle, in pairs and trios.

Helga caressed the signet ring on her finger, seeking confidence from the carved stone. Red, like the blood on her father’s neck.

“I wish you had given me time to prepare your hair.” Saga tilted her blonde head as she coiled one of Helga’s kinky strands of hair, still smelling like the pyre, around her finger. “It is a rightful mess right now.”

“I would if we had the time.” Helga chuckled mirthlessly, anxiously staring beyond the trees. Too many were missing from the gathering, who should have been there. She pulled away from her friend’s care. “Come, we must not leave them waiting.” Too many whose ashes mingled with the burned-down house.

 Her gaze flittered over the gathered. Most seemed welcoming. Fjalar Halfdane, however, had his arms crossed over his chest, a scowl darkening his tanned face. If she convinced him, the rest would be easy.

 “My people, I greet you.” She pitched her voice as she remembered her father’s, slipping her thumbs into her belt. All to mimic the chieftain’s proud stance. “I am my father’s heir, and you know that it is lawful.” Saga kneeling by her feet strengthened her resolve. From Saga’s first steps, she had been by Helga’s side, and she was the one person whose loyalty she did not doubt.

 “You are just a girl.” Fjalar shot back. “What do you know about leading, or ruling for that matter?”

She met everyone’s gaze but his. “We have all suffered losses today. Friends. Family. And an honourable and glorious leader, in both war and peace.” She raised her voice and her left hand, the signet ring catching the setting sun’s light. “He never surrendered but died as he lived: on his feet, unbroken.” She struggled with the words, tears forming in her eyes. “He was, he was …” She blinked away the tears. One word a time. One person a time. “He was my father. By the gods of our ancestors, I. Will. Avenge him.” She slammed her fist into her chest. Even Fjalar echoed the gesture, and  tears glittered in his eyes. But so did ambition.

“I hear your words.” He straightened up, his finger running over his scarred cheek. “You want our loyalty in return for words? You want us to die for you?” His rough hands bore marks of farming and war.

“No.” She adopted the composed arrogance of her dead step-mother, raising her chin. “I want you to live for me. I want you to survive, to do anything you need to be here when I return.” She paused for effect. “And yes, I want your loyalty, and your faith in me.” She held out a hand to him. “Fjalar, my father trusted you. I want to do the same.”

“You are a woman.” He crossed his arms over his chest. “He earned my loyalty through many acts that no woman can perform.”

“I may not be a man, but I have enough of what it takes.” She grabbed at her groin with a thrusting movement.

His eyes widened and his jaw went slack. Too far?

Fjalar’s frown turned into a broad grin, and he grabbed her bronzed cinnamon hand, almost swallowing it with his own freckled one. 

Forcing the momentum, she raised her to be heard across the gathering, directing her words to everyone standing within the tall boulders, but her gaze lay on Fjalar. “Words, however, are not enough. A promise of action, but only when translated into plans.”

“I agree, my Lady Helga Ramn.” He bowed his rye-blonde head. “What are your plans?” Challenge had not left his blue eyes, but respect had joined it.

She reclaimed her hand, shifting her pose to include everyone. Her hands rested in the belt, her back straightened, and she rocked gently on her heels. “I will leave at dawn to see what support I can gather.” She hid her doubts behind a self-assured mask. “Within the year, I will return, or send someone carrying a message sealed with my father’s seal. Until then, the most important order I have for you is survival. Survive, thrive and gather information.” Her people listened. Even Fjalar could be counted among her people.

“Fjalar, you are the only survivor of my father’s warriors.” She muted her pain; her voice lost its vibrant timbre, but retained its power. “Act as my commander here until I return. From you, I need information about our enemy. Numbers. Weak points. Who can we convince to join us.”

“And if you do not return?” He crossed his arms over his chest.

“If by midsummer next year you have not heard from me, do what you feel is necessary.” If only she had a horn of ale to wet her throat. “Toke, you are a free man now.” She turned her attention to an old man with a stooped back and a scraggly beard. “When the invaders come to take possession of my father’s lands, I want you to have ensured that there is nothing of our back’s fruits for them to take. Clean out the storage. Anything that can be salvaged should be used for my people, and my people alone.”

Toke grinned, flashing browning and missing teeth. “Of course, my Lady.”

“I am glad for each and every one of you that came here.” She glanced down at her hands. “Whether you follow our ancestor’s faith, or this White Christ, you are welcome under my banner.” Her gaze ran over the congregation, recognising nervousness on several faces, mingled with excitement. “All that matters is that I am your chieftain. No matter what you need to do to survive, stay true to me, and the memory of my father.” She slammed her fist into her chest.

Toke knelt, and the wave danced outward until she, alone, stood.

The soft murmurs of the people surged into the roaring ocean. “Long live Helga Ramn, Helga Yngvesdotter, our chieftain.”

Excitement and dread mingled with the flame of retribution set by the King’s actions. Every life taken—and for what, to make an example out of those refusing to abandon their faith?—would be accounted for before she surrendered.

Somehow.

Enjoy February,

Antonius Marie
