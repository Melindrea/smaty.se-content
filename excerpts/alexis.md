**1st draft, tense/pov will change**

The light touch of her fingers on my cheek sends jolts of electricity scurrying across my skin.

“You have to hurry and pack. He’s coming to let you know that you’re leaving in fifteen.” Helene’s teasing lisp carries the slight whine of her mid-Swedish dialect.

I fold the shirt carefully. “You’re quite the nag for a hallucination, you know.”

“I’m only looking out for you, Alexis.” She bites into her lip, brushing a strand of wet, brown hair out of her eyes. “We’ll always be friends.”

“I wish.” I close my eyes as I zip up the bag.

“Alexis, are you ready?” My current foster father knocks on the door. “We’re leaving in fifteen, and you need to eat something.”

Helene is gone again, and I struggle to my feet. Why did I think it was a good idea to go to a summer camp, again? No one answers.

After scarfing down breakfast and waving my good-byes, I left on the train for Middle-of-nowhere-hede, two hours north of Gothenburg. The seat is narrow, and under me the engine rattles and moves.

I wake with a jolt as the robotic voice calls my station, gathering my few belongings. The cheerful Sia Starholm—what exactly is her role, apart from recruiter?—waits on the platform, but not alone. A slender punk, with light-brown skin and a black mohawk, taps his fingers on his loose jeans, and a freckled girl with golden braids stands patiently with folded hands.

“Alexis, over here.” Sia waves with a broad smile on her round features. “Yngve and Karin, this is Alexis. We’re still waiting for two more—Slava, over here!”

Slava has black hair down their back, and a trimmed black beard. Their hips sway just slightly as they approach us, and a smile twitches on their lips. “I’m Slava.” They have a slavic intonation, but perfect Swedish. “To stop you from wondering: I am non-binary. My pronouns are they, them, themself.”

Karin looks stunned at the revelation. I hold out a hand.

“Cool. I’m Alexis. My pronouns are she.”

Slava shakes my hand, squeezing it a moment. “Nice to meet you.”

“And Jahid makes five.”

I glance in the direction Sia’s watching. Jahid is about my height, with russet brown skin and black curls. He waves and shifts the position of his backpack.

“This is where the summer party is?” His white teeth shine in his face, and his black eyes glitter with mirth. I think I’m going to like him.

“That’s all, yes.” Sia pushes a hand through her black hair, leading us towards the van. “There’s lunch ready when we get to the house, and you can explore after lunch.” We pack our various bags and suitcases into the back as she talks. “We’ll go through the rules and procedures right before dinner, but the key one is respect. Listen to each other, respect each other, and respect each others differences.”

Yeah, right. Except for Slava, what kind of weird differences could we have? Yngve is the typical swaggering guy, Karin is cute but shy, and Jahid seems pretty normal too.
