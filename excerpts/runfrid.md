**1st draft**

Runfrid knelt by the rune stone, lighting the incense she had brought with her. On the flat granite surface in front of it, she lay down three locks of hair bound with copper threads.

“Six full moons have passed since you choose Rán’s embrace to mine.” She whispered the words, closing her eyes as hot tears trickled down her freckled cheeks. “And I still do not know if I still love you, or if you killed my love.” Grief wrecked her body, with sobs forcing themselves out despite her best efforts.

“Cry not, mistress.” The melodic voice, with a broken accent, of her husband’s thrall broke through her grief. The woman lay a tanned hand on her shoulder.

Runfrid straightened, shielding her emotions with her pride. “I was not crying.” The discomfort flittered up her spine, and again she wondered why she had not sold her when Mór threw himself off the cliff.

At the rejection, Esti’s face stiffened into a mask of hurt. “Of course, mistress.” Her hand resting on her swollen belly stung in Runfrid’s heart, and tears flooded her eyes again. She sank to her knees, unable to stop herself, sobbing against the ground. The thrall knelt with her, taking her hand and holding it, while the storm washed over Runfrid, until the grief ebbed away and left only the emptiness she was used to.

She met Esti’s grey eyes and read only sympathy in them. “Why are you comforting me?” She pulled her cloak around herself.

Esti shrugged. “You not sell me.” She smiled lightly. “You not hate me, despite …” She gestured at her stomach with an awkward movement.

Despite. The thought bit into Runfrid as she rose again, hoping she could wash the redness away before anyone else saw her. She stalked into the low house, her head bowed, leaving Esti by Mór’s rune stone and memorial. The only one they had, as his body had not yet washed ashore.
