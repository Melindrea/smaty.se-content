The axe smashed through the Dál Riatan’s jaw, cleaving it. Kóri tore the axe free, spinning to attack the enemy coming up behind him. Green eyes in a face streaked with dirt and blood met his, before Bóthildr pulled her spear out of the man behind him.

“Get back.” Kóri used the momentary lull to frantically look for an escape route. “You will die!”

“Then may Freja take me.” Bóthildr’s eyes flashed in anger. “This is my fight as much as yours.”

He cursed silently over stubborn womenfolk, but the moment had passed. All he could do was pray. “Back to back. If you die, I die.”

“I will not lose you.” She turned her back towards his, close enough for him to protect her—and she him—but distant enough that they both could move. With Kóri’s focus on his axe, he felt more than saw the man charging Bóthildr. He and Bóthildr took the battlefield on together, back to back. The rain invaded his cloak, his chainmail, his undershirt, leaving his hair stuck to his neck.

Bóthildr growled, taking off on light feet, gripping the spear tightly enough for her knuckles to pale.

“What …? Bóthildr!” He followed her, scanning the enemies ahead. Her tense back and singular attention convinced him she was not fleeing. He wiped blood and rain out of his eyes with the back of his hand.

Bóthildr growled again, thrusting the spear into a man fighting with Hallbjórn. The man stumbled back in shock, and Hallbjórn tossed her a surprised glance.

“He is mine.” She spat in the Dál Riatan’s face. Around his neck a bronze cross glittered in the few rays of sun breaking through the dark clouds. “You killed my father!”

Hallbjórn dodged out of her way with an approving grin, flanking her right with his shield locking with hers. Kóri flung himself in the way of the Dál Riatan’s sword, blocking it with his axe and joining her on the left. The two skilled warriors on either side of her granted her the chance to sacrifice defence for offence. She turned the spear in her hand minutely. While the thrust was shallow, it sliced into the tunic and stained the iron. The man’s dirty face displayed shock and surprise, and he seemed to be pulling his blows. Because Bóthildr was a woman? Insulting and irrelevant. She was of Ranrike.

The Dál Riatan ducked under their weapons, displaying uncanny skill. His early hesitations faded in the face of opposition, and a single blow cut into Bóthildr’s ribs. She slammed the shield into her foe, driven by searing rage and pure will.

Other defenders joined the single Dál Riatan, but more Nordmenn also joined the three. With a final thrust of her spear, Bóthildr impaled her foe. Glaring down at his dead body she leaned on the spear and pinned him to the ground. She ripped the bronze cross from his neck, holding it high in triumph. Gudhlek Smith would rest in glory, his death avenged.
