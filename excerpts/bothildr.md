The axe smashed through the Dál Riatan’s jaw, cleaving it. Kóri tore the axe free, spinning to attack the enemy coming up behind him. Green eyes in a face streaked with dirt and blood met his, before Bóthildr pulled her spear out of the man behind him.

“Get back.” Kóri used the momentary lull to frantically look for an escape route. “You will die!”

“Then may Freja take me.” Bóthildr’s eyes flashed in anger. “This is my fight as much as yours.”

He cursed silently over stubborn womenfolk, but the brief moment had passed. All he could do was pray. “Back to back. If you die, I die.”

“I will not lose you.” She turned her back towards his, close enough for him to protect her—and she him—but distant enough that they both had free movement. Kóri felt more than saw the opponent taking on Bóthildr, his entire focus on his axe. They took the battlefield on together, back to back.

Bóthildr growled, taking off on light feet.

“What …? Bóthildr!” He followed her, scanning the enemies ahead. Her tense back and singular focus convinced him she was not fleeing.

The target of her focus fought with Hallbjórn, a bronze cross glittering around his neck. Bóthildr growled again, lunging at the man.

“He is mine.” She spat in the Dál Riatan’s face, raising her sword. “You killed my father!”

Hallbjórn dodged out of her way, flanking her left. Kóri flung himself in the way of the Dál Riatan’s sword, blocking it with his axe and joining her on the right. With two skilled warriors on either side of her, she could focus on her quarry.

The man’s dirty face displayed shock and surprise, and he seemed to be pulling his blows. Because Bóthildr was a woman? Insulting and irrelevant. She was of Ranrike.

The weapons of the three all had longer range than the Dál Riatan’s short sword, but he was far more skilled than Bóthildr. She slammed the shield into her foe, driven by searing rage and pure will.

Other defenders joined the single Dál Riatan, but more Nordmenn also joined the three. With a final thrust of her spear, Bóthildr impaled her foe. Glaring down at his dead body she pinned him to the ground and reached closer to rip the bronze cross from his neck. Gudhlek Smith would rest in glory, his death avenged.
