Friday evening, Katja’s train arrived at Tanum station. Sia met her on the platform, kissing her softly.

“Hey. How’s the dreams?” Her hands slipped around Katja’s neck.

“They’re fine.” Katja shook her head impatiently. “Not sure the same with me, though. I don’t want to think about it. Not right now.”

“We’ll have to foodshop before heading home.” Sia’s hand slid down to rest on Katja’s hip. “Anything you feel like?”

“Something light. Cheese and crackers?” Katja hugged her girlfriend close, kissing her neck teasingly. “Wine. Nakedness.”

“We do have an entire large—and largely unrenovated—farm to ourselves …” Sia chuckled, slipping into the driver seat of her car.

When they reached the farm, a large, wolf-like creature met them. He reached up to Katja’s waist, the head shaggy, in gray and white. Despite the menacing appearance his yellow eyes and the scar over his left eye gave him, he whuffled and nosed at Katja.

“Hey, Gråtass.” She scratched him behind the ears, struck by the bizarre juxtaposition between who he was and who he appeared to be. However, she reflected as she dug her fingers into his grey-and-white fur, if she could find someone to feed her and scratch her, maybe she wouldn’t object either.

*You are looking tired.* The glint in his yellow eyes matched his gravelly mind-voice and was distinctly wicked. He knew that she knew that he knew why.

“Yes, well, I’ve had a lot to do.” Nope. Not letting an ulv get the better of her.

*You know what you need to do.* He followed her back to the car as she grabbed the suitcase. She ignored him, refusing to think of the labyrinth and the chainmail hidden deep in her closet.

Sia carried the groceries in ahead of her, and Katja’s mood turned for the better watching her broad hips and the way the skirt accentuated her curves.

“That’s a sight for sore eyes,” she teased, setting the suitcase down in the large farmhouse kitchen.

“What is?” Sia unpacked the cold cuts, letting her hazel gaze run over her domains. The stone floor had several woven carpets, the old stone counters topped with new planks of oak.

“You.” Katja pulled her to her, stroking Sia’s hips from behind. “I miss you.”

“You could move here, you know … It’s not that far to travel, and you aren’t always needed in Stockholm.”

Katja released her, stepping away to busy herself with … something. Anything.

“It’s okay if you don’t want to, though.” Sia bit into her lip, and Katja cursed herself mentally.

“I love you,” she said, not answering either of the questions. “Let’s get dinner going, and then we can sit on your porch with a glass of wine.”
