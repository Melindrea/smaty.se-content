**2nd draft**

The dream-child’s crying fades, and the crone’s cackle transforms into the seagulls’ cruel mockery. Another night without peace. Outside the window waves crash against the cliffs, isolating me from the world that has forsaken me. Nausea fills the desolate pit of my stomach, and I fight back tears. Do I still believe that there is something at the other end? I don’t know.

Iron and bile rise in my throat. I stumble out of the bed on trembling legs, shuffling to the bathroom.

*You’re worthless, everyone thinks so*. Henrik’s voice drips with thinly veiled contempt. Holding the cold porcelain edges of the sink I retch, my cheeks tear-streaked and my blond locks clinging to my sweaty forehead. *No one except me thinks you deserve to be loved. I’m your only friend.* I hadn’t seen Henrik for many years, but his voice haunts me. And it’s right.

My hands tremble, and I stare down. Though the mirror is covered with dark cloth, I don’t want to risk it. Risk meeting the eyes of the stranger that is I.

*You are a freak.*

My breaths are short and laboured as I fight against the panic and the traitor in me.

Heartbeat.

The first rays of the sun flicker through the bathroom window. I push myself to stand. Exhaustion floods my tense body. The snug tank-top binder reforms my upper body, and I can breathe again. The feminine stranger has transformed into me. Without bothering with shoes I pad outside in boxers and the top.

My lungs fill with salty air, and the August chill flow over my skin, numbing it. Under my feet the stones are rough with patches of grass. I rest against the log wall of my cottage, enjoying the sensation of goose bumps spreading along my bare skin.

Frozen but content I stumble inside. My phone blinks on the counter. A new message. No, I don’t want to think of Gabriel. My body call for coffee, but instead I sit down on the mat in front of the cold hearth.

With my feet tugged underneath me, I close my eyes and force deep breaths: in through the nose, hold, out through the mouth slowly. I want to focus on the Khanda, symbol of my faith, but my mind roils with the crying of children and the laughter of a crone. Protect the innocent? How could I, when I couldn’t even bear a child to term?

Serenity slips out of my grip. Meditation didn’t help this time either.
