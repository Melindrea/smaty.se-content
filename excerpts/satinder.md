Waves crash against the cliffs outside, a roaring barrier between me and a world that has forsaken me. I clutch the cold edges of the sink. Iron and bile flood my mouth. Tears streak my cheeks, and sweat sticks tufts of blond hair stick to my forehead. Another restless night; is there an end? I don’t know.

My hands grip the porcelain until they are as white as it is. The mirror is covered with a black towel; I don’t want to risk meeting the eyes. Of the stranger that is wearing my face.

"You are a freak." Henrik’s voice drips with contempt, appearing behind me. Maybe by the door?

My every breath is shallow. Short. Searing. I fight the traitor in me and reach for the white box and the sheet within. When I punch out a white pill, my trembling fingers drop it on the floor. It bounce, bounce, bounces behind the cabinet. My stomach contracts as I sink down on my knees. A vein on my temple pulsates painfully.

“Can’t I just have one day?” I whisper into the silence. “Just one good day, without nightmares and without—”

"No. You know what you did." He seems closer, his voice growing stronger.

I swallow the pill and close my eyes. “It wasn’t my fault. I couldn’t …”

"Of course you couldn’t." His voice looms over me, and I wrap my arms around my body. "You never could. Or did."

Dim sun-rays flicker through the bathroom window. Exhaustion floods my senses.

“Leave me alone.” I grip the sink and pull myself back up. “Please, leave me alone.” Staring away from the mirror I grab the binder and tighten it around my chest. I want the lumps to go away, and the hips to slim into nothingness. With the tank-top and loose cotton shorts I can breathe again. The feminine stranger has transformed into me.

"You can’t ignore me." Henrik’s voice grows weaker as my beating heart slows. I pad outside on bare feet.

With each breath, my lungs fill with salty air. The September chill caresses me, and the chilly bedrock bites into my soles despite patches of wilting grass. I sink down and rest my head back against the greying logs of my cottage. Goosebumps spread along my bare skin. Numbing my body numbs my mind.

The mist hangs low, with the sun reflecting in morning dew. A sudden wind tears through the leaves, and I choke on the stench of death. Every hair on my arms stand on end, and malevolence drowns my skin. It feels like someone, or something, is watching me. Seagulls cry and laugh in the distance.

I rush inside to get away, but the oily sense of evil clings to me.

 My phone blinks on the counter, with a new message, but instead of dealing with that, I move to the mat in front of the hearth.

 With feet tucked underneath me, I close my eyes and force deep breaths. In through the nose, hold, out through the mouth slowly. After five breaths I open my eyes again and stare at the fireplace’s scorched bricks.

 My mouth chants Waheguru—Wonderful Teacher, creator of all—but my mind roils with memories of the crying of children and the laughter of a crone.

 Protect the innocent? How can I, when I couldn’t even carry a child to term?

Serenity slips out of my grip.

Again.
