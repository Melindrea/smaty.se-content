**First draft**

Vanja rested back in the car-seat, with a Sibelius violin concert streaming into their ears. Their mother glanced back and mouthed something, but Vanja ignored her and focused on wrapping the jean jacket closer around them. As their mom’s gesturing became more agitated, they plucked one of the ear buds out.

“What?” Vanja tensed up, looking out through the window on the green fields and bared bedrock rolling by.

“We’re there in ten minutes. And please try to mind your manners.” Their mother tugged a hand through her bleached pixie cut. “Dad is doing you a favour.”

Vanja rolled their eyes. “No, he’s doing you a favour. You promised me I’d get my own apartment.” They stared out the window, though not quite daring to  drown their parents out with music again.

“And you know very well why we can’t trust you with your own apartment.” Their father’s deep voice was deep with finality to it. “Johannes will keep you safe and out of trouble while we’re away.”

“I barely know grandpa.” Vanja packed down their phone, resentment oozing through their voice.

“Then it is certainly time you learn to know him.” Their mother’s voice was short. “We’re here, and behave.”

Vanja climbed out of the car and grabbed their backpack. Johannes met them, sporting a brown checkered tweed hat and dark pants with a jersey over it.

“So this is my lovely grandchild.” He hugged Vanja. A faint scent of tobacco, fabric softener and wood floated around him. They hugged him back hesitatingly. “Welcome. I’ve prepared your mother’s old room for you.” He glanced over at their parents. “I hope you’re hungry, stew should be ready.” He picked up a suitcase and led the three towards the large farmhouse. Behind it the forest and stretched out, interspersed with bared bedrock. Though Vanja would still have preferred their own apartment, at least their grandfather seemed kind and friendly.

“Your mother tells me you play the violin?” Johannes glanced back at Vanja, who nodded. “I did once too, but I decided that my place was in building them, not playing them. Now I only play to make sure each instrument I sell has the right sound.”

“Dad, that reminds me. We’ve bought a present for Vanja, but she’ll be needing your help with it.”

Vanja twitched at the female pronoun, though trying to keep it subtle. The only one who seemed to notice was their grandfather.
