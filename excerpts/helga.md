Helga sputtered and coughed, clearing her lungs from water. She flailed, before freeing herself from the shawl and loose dress ensnaring her. Hard rocks dug into her back and algae twisted around her bare legs, but she was out of the water.

“Mistress, are you alright?” Saga, her short blonde hair messily tucked behind her ears, looked down at her. Her undyed shift was gathered at the wrists, and both sleeves and the bottom of the skirt were wet.

“Yes.” Impatiently Helga sat up, pushing away a black curl with a dark hand. “The estate? I saw my father and Torun, but …” Her brown eyes narrowed and she clamped her mouth shut.

Saga shivered, closing her eyes. “They burned it. The shut everyone inside, and they, they, they burned it to the ground.” She tugged at grass growing in a crack in the bedrock. “I hid, and I saw them drag you.” She hesitatingly reached for her mistress’ hand, and Helga squeezed it gently. “I am glad you are alive.”

“Not for long, if they get their wish.” Helga frowned in concentration, pushing away the grief at the death of her father and step-mother, not to mention the destruction of her home. Without plans for the future neither she nor her thrall would survive longer than a week, if even that. “Curse them. They have shown their true colours now.” She glanced over at Saga. “Or are you interested in converting?” Her question was honest, and the thrall furrowed her brow as she considered it.

“No, I do not think so.” She rested back against a rock. “The missionaries spoke of peace, of all being equal.” She looked down a moment, wetting her lips. “Of everyone being free. But this was not peace. They murdered your father, the chieftain, for refusing conversion.” She shook her head. “No. If those are the men that represents White Christ and Christianity, I want no part of it.”

“Good.” The water itself spoke, and Helga leaped to her feet, standing between Saga and the being that rose out of the ocean. The deity was female, her green hair tipped with the white of waves, and her body glittering with gold. “And you, dark child, known as Helga Ramn, raven born.” Her voice stormed and sang as the wild ocean. “Will you cower before your betters, these men of Christ, to save your life?”

A flash of anger danced in Helga’s eyes, her back stiffening. “I bow to no one. They will bow to me.” She was young, she knew this. “I swear this to you, Ran, Aegir’s wife, that I will have my vengeance, and my father will not have died in vain.”

“I feed on your rage and retribution.” The deity embraced Helga in her watery form. “What you lack in power, you have in ambition. Serve me, and we will both find vengeance.”

“Serve you … how?” She wet her lips, meeting the deity’s black eyes. “What is it you want from me, and what do I get in return?”
