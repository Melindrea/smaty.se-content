**1st draft**

Linda yawned, hopping out of the shower with a towel wrapped around herself and her cane firmly under her armpit for balance. She froze, staring through the open door into her bedroom, where a large snake lay coiled on the suitcase on her bed. Screaming, she stumbled backwards, to the laughter of her two roommates.

“Calm, Linda, it’s just a toy.” Henrik grinned and grabbed it. “See?”

She backed away, even though she saw that the eyes weren’t real, and the scales were plastic. “Assholes. You know how much I hate them.”

“Sorry, it seemed funny.” Susanne’s eyes glittered with amusement. “We won’t do it again, I promise.”

“Sorry.” Henrik tossed the snake into a basket with a sure arm. “We didn’t mean any harm, you know that.”

“I know.” Linda shook her head. “Doesn’t mean you’re less of assholes. I swear that if I find any toy snakes in my luggage, I will cut you.” She hopped back to her room, rubbing her arm where the cane had jammed into her. “Now shoo, I have a train to catch.” Linda closed the door and sat down on the bed to towel her brown hair dry. “I’m going to kill them one of these days,” she muttered, but a smile played on her lips. “Goofs.” With a final glance around the room, she established that she’d packed everything she needed for the summer. “My entire life in two suitcases and a backpack. Harsh.” She locked her prosthetic leg in place, flexing it a bit before slipping into a pair of worn jeans and a frilly blouse. She twirled her hair into a bun and carefully stood up on two legs.

“Henrik, can you help me carry the suitcases to the hall?” She opened the door. “You owe me that after nearly giving me a heart-attack.”

“Sure.” He grabbed the bags. “It’s going to be empty without you here, but I bet you’ll have it nice and comfortable at your mum’s.”

“Yeah, right.” She shook her head and hoisted her backpack up. “I flunked Algebraic Topology, so need to spend some extra time with that, rather than leisurely enjoy the summer. And, you know, working.”

“Better you than me. No, I’ll stick to my summer courses.” He placed the bags by the door. “Need any more help?”

“No, I got it from here.” She pulled on her oxblood trench-coat, balanced to get the backpack on and grabbed the suitcases to head out.
