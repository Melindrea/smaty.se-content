**First draft, tense and PoV under experimentation.** One of the stories that will be written during Camp NaNoWriMo now in April.

The child’s crying faded as I awake. My heart races, and in the distance I hear mocking laughter of seagulls. It sounds like human laughter. Stumbling out of bed I rush to the bathroom, fighting the nausea in the pit of my stomach.

The sun rise while I lean over the basin. My hands grip the cold porcelain as I retch. The mirror is covered with a dark cloth so I don’t need to see the face of a stranger. Forcing myself to start the day, I tighten the binder around my breasts. At least then I can face myself. The hormones evened out my body, but they needed some help.

My hair still hangs loose down to my shoulders, and I pull on a pair of jeans and a T-shirt, walking barefoot outside. The August morning is chilly, and my lungs fill with salty air. The chill on my skin numb me, and I find enough peace to go back inside.
