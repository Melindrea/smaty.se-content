**First draft**

The child’s crying fade as I awake. My heart races, and in the distance seagulls laugh mockingly. Like human laughter. Stumbling out of bed I rush to the bathroom, fighting the nausea in the pit of my stomach.

The sun rises while I lean over the basin. My hands grips the cold porcelain as I retch. The mirror is covered with dark cloth; I don’t want to meet the eyes of the stranger. Forcing myself to start the day, I tighten the binder around my breasts. At least then I can face myself. The hormones evened out my body, but they needed some help.

My hair still hangs loose down to my shoulders, and I pull on a pair of loose pants and a T-shirt, walking barefoot outside. The August morning is chilly, and my lungs fill with salty air. The chill on my skin numbs me, and I find enough peace to go back inside, trembling in the soft breeze.

My phone blinks on the counter. A new message. I cover the phone with a dust rag and exorcise any thought of Gabriel as I sit down on the mat, tugging my feet underneath me. My heart races, but I close my eyes and force deep breaths: in through the nose, hold, out through the mouth slowly. I want to focus on the imagery of a double-edged sword, but my mind roils with the crying of children and the laughter of a crone. Protect the innocent? How could I, when I couldn’t even bear a child to term?

Once again, I stop meditating half-way through.
